<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>My name is Christopher Cairns and I am an aspiring website and software developer. I have been studying part time
  through the Open University and have been taking courses on Udemy and Codecademy in my spare time to help me
  understand programming a bit better.</p>
<p>At this moment in my life I am studying HTML, CSS and Python. Once I feel I have got to grips with Python I will move
  on to Javascript for the purpose of web development.</p>
<p>I hope that one day I can be employed as a full stack developer. </p>
