<h1>My Favourite Movies, by Chris Cairns</h1>
<h2>My Top 3:</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Godfather Part II</h3>
<p>A gangster movie set in two different time periods. One about the rise of a young 'Don' Vito Corleone after he moves
    his family from Italy to New York City. The other set years after as his son takes control of the family business
    and becomes the new Godfather.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince</h3>
<p>A movie based on J.K. Rowling's book about a young wizard of the same name. It's the best movie of the series for me
    as it sets up the ending perfectly and the fact that Snape kills Dumbledore at the end only for the last book and
    movie to show Snape done it at Dumbledore's asking and he was a good person who looked after Harry the whole time.

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>The second Christopher Nolan film about the vigilante superhero is an absolute classic. The fact that Batman doesn't
    even steal the show says it all. Heath Ledgers portrayal of the super-villain The Joker, might just be the greatest
    bit of acting
    of the 21st century!</p>
